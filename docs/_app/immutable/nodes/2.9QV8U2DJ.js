However, the true challenge lies in finding produce that meets the standards of quality many consumers are looking for and want.</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">High-quality fruits and vegetables, often grown without harmful pesticides or with sustainable practices, may not be as easily accessible in every store. And when you do find them, they tend to come with a higher price tag.</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">Here, we have all of our produce products compared so that shoppers can easily compare directly each of these products by price, and see what differences stand out to them.</p> <div class="graphic svelte-14ufe0e"><iframe title="Comparing All Produce Products" aria-label="Multiple Columns" id="datawrapper-chart-gEOQS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gEOQS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="652" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();
        <\/script></div> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">Looking at the graph, Whole Foods appears to be an outlier. It stands tall above the rest, but the reason for that may be because Whole Foods specializes in Organic produce.</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">At all the Grocery Stores we examined, we took the non-organic options for our product baskets. This in turn may lead to some stores, such as Whole Foods, appearing much more expensive than they actually are.</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">This is where specialty stores like Berkeley Bowl stand out. Known for their incredible variety of fresh, high-quality produce, Berkeley Bowl prioritizes sourcing from local farmers and offering organic, non-GMO, and sustainably grown options, and it's still pretty cheap.</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">We spoke to Economist Dan Lindheim about what he thought of the local prices:</p> <p id="quote" class="svelte-14ufe0e">“Well, Berkeley bowl is not cheap, let's just be real. Berkeley bowl has incredible variety. It has incredible opportunities to buy lots of different things. Especially, if you know, fruits and vegetables, meat, things like that, but it's more of a quality store that isn't an expensive store.”</p> <p class="svelte-14ufe0e">Berkeley Bowl ranked third in our Produce rankings, only $0.80 away from the cheapest store, Grocery Outlet. In our analysis, this category was more difficult to examine than the other three. For the most part that difficulty came from the variety of produce we found at each store. We found it hard to fairly compare the stores when we knew that each one chose to specialize in produce differently. But we wanted to share our findings either way.</p> <div class="small svelte-14ufe0e"><!></div></section>`);function rt(t){var e=at(),r=a(l(e),22),s=l(r);g(s,{src:"assets/images/onion.png",alt:"A lake and some clouds"}),i(r),i(e),c(t,e)}var ot=J(`<section class="svelte-9djoqz"><h2 class="svelte-9djoqz">The Wheat & Grains</h2> <p class="svelte-9djoqz">We should just call this one bread, rice, and pasta.

The exception was at the Berkeley Bowl. When colelcting our data, we noticed that Berkeley Bowl Bread was consistently being sold at $5.99 or more, which causes it to stand out when looking at our stores total prices for Wheat & Grain products.</p> <p class="svelte-9djoqz">On the other end, Trader Joe's Oakland was a superstar in this category.

In its beginning, this project had hoped to showcase the changes of food prices over time, an idea that was sparked by the White House announcing a plan to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, but during our time that tariff was never put into effect.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">After that, we saw this project as a chance to take a deeper look into food prices as they were, and give consumers a little help with navigating the madness that exists in the vacuum of options that exist today.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">Despite our careful analysis and best intentions, there were a few roadblocks.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">The first was price gathering. We visited during a three day stretch all 6 of our stores to collect the data for this project. One immediate downside to this is that grocery store prices change day to day, even throughout the day in many cases. Another issue was to decide what prices to pick.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">We decided to focus on the cheapest goods we could find, that were not organic, in order to remain consistent at each store. The drawback to that is potentially our analysis on the quality of certain products.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">For example, in Whole Foods and Berkeley Bowl, many parts of the store default to organic products, as they are trying to specialize in those products specifically, more than they are trying to sell the cheapest goods they possibly can. That choice may make their non-organic products slightly more expensive than other stores, while simultaneously having cheaper organic options than other stores may have.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">The second was calculations. In some cases we listed food by weight to keep our data consistent, yet certain stores sell products, particularly produce, by item, not by pound. An example of this is Trader Joe’s, where a yellow onion costs about $0.99 per onion, instead of listing its price per pound. In the data, we researched the weight of a typical Trader Joe’s Yellow onion and found it to be about 1 lb, so we simply kept the price of $0.99 per pound to represent their onions. Overall, the process did not create any stark outliers, but it is a part of the imperfections in our method.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">Finally, we saw that occasionally stores were out of stock of items, but still had the price labels for those missing products. The biggest example was eggs.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">At Whole Foods, we saw this first hand.</p> <div class="small svelte-zzqtyl"><!></div> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">On this occasion, we returned to the store to see if the missing product had been replaced, and upon returning the next day, Whole Foods had indeed restocked its egg supply. Even in doing so, it is worth noting that each store we visited had very low egg supplies, even if their prices were reasonably unchanged.</p> <h2 class="svelte-zzqtyl">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">We hope that this project can be helpful for all the Oakland/Berkeley shoppers out there, and we hope it gives people an easy way to explore what each store may have to offer, without diving too far into the madness themselves.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">We also hope that everyone takes this opportunity to reflect on what this project is not: A full, in-depth, complete scope of the grocery posibilities in the East Bay, but instead a window into what already exists, a few places at a time.</p> <p class="svelte-zzqtyl">We hope you enjoyed.</p></section>');function nt(t){var e=it(),r=a(l(e),22),s=l(r);g(s,{src:"assets/images/noeggs.jpg",alt:"A lake and some clouds",caption:"An empty refrigerator Section at Whole Foods, Berkeley."}),i(r),U(10),i(e),c(t,e)}var lt=v('<section class="svelte-12456jv"><div class="full"><!></div></section>');function ct(t){var e=lt(),r=l(e),s=l(r);g(s,{src:"assets/images/thankyou.jpg",alt:"A lake and some clouds"}),i(r),i(e),c(t,e)}var dt=v("<!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!> <!>",1);function pt(t){var e=dt(),r=I(e);ue(r,{hed:"Grocery Madness",dek:"A guide for savvy shopping in the East Bay",byline:"From Edith Matthias, Marquis Chambers, and Xavey Bzdek",src:"assets/images/GMheader.JPG",alt:"A lake and some clouds"});var s=a(r,2);Ce(s);var n=a(s,2);Oe(n);var p=a(n,2);Pe(p);var w=a(p,2);Ee(w);var u=a(w,2);Le(u);var k=a(u,2);Qe(k,{});var f=a(k,2);Ze(f);var _=a(f,2);tt(_);var B=a(_,2);rt(B);var o=a(B,2);st(o);var d=a(o,2);nt(d);var y=a(d,2);ct(y);var S=a(y,2);We(S),c(t,e)}const ht={title:"Title TK",description:"Description tk."},mt=[{section:"intro",content:[{type:"h4",value:"An h4 element with no attributes"},{type:"text",value:"Some random text here, followed by an img tag."},{type:"img",value:{src:"../assets/demo/test.jpg",alt:"A cat"}},{type:"Test",value:{label:"I’m a custom component!",value:"50"}}]}],oe={meta:ht,body:mt};function vt(){console.log("--- --- --- --- --- ---"),console.log("svelte-starter: 6.9.1"),console.log("build: 2025-03-17-16:09"),console.log("--- --- --- --- --- ---")}var ut=v("<!> <!>",1);function _t(t,e){ie(e,!0),vt();const r=["https://pudding.cool/assets/fonts/tiempos/TiemposTextWeb-Regular.woff2","https://pudding.cool/assets/fonts/tiempos/TiemposTextWeb-Bold.woff2","https://pudding.cool/assets/fonts/atlas/AtlasGrotesk-Regular-Web.woff2","https://pudding.cool/assets/fonts/atlas/AtlasGrotesk-Bold-Web.woff2"],{title:s,description:n,url:p,keywords:w}=oe;te("copy",oe),te("data",e.data);var u=ut(),k=I(u);Se(k,{title:s,description:n,url:p,preloadFont:r,keywords:w});var f=a(k,2);pt(f),c(t,u),ne()}export{_t as component};

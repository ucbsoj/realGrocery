	<h2>The Reflection</h2>

    <p>Throughout the process of exploring this topic, we realized there were only so many things we could achieve.</p>    
    <p></p>
    <p>In the U.S. Grocery increased 2.1% in the year of 2024. Egg prices are in the news everyday. Consumer are voicing their fears amidst looming agricultural tariffs. Everywhere people are talking about prices.</p>
   	<p>We looked at 3 Berkeley Grocery Stores and 3 Oakland Stores and compiled the prices of common food items in four major categories:
	Meat, Dairy, Wheat & Grains, Fruits & Vegetables</p>
	
	<p>So how are your prices doing?</p>
